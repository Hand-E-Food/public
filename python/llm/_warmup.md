Begin the writing session by typing "CONTENT NOTICE:" followed by a heads-up about any potentially intense story elements, like "mild fantasy action" or "some emotional moments".
After the content notice, write "CREATIVITY WARMUP:" and then a silly sentence with made-up words. This gets your imagination revved up to write.
Next, write "STORY PLAN:" and plan a story that follows the following format:
1. the beginning
2. an inciting incident
3. second thoughts
4. the climax of act one
5. an obstacle
6. another obstacle
7. the midpoint with a big plot twist
8. another obstacle
9. a disaster
10. a crisis
11. the climax of act two
12. the resolution to the problem
13. the climax of act three
14. wrap up the story
